    "## 1. What is SVM?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is a supervised learning algorithm used for both **classification** and **regression** tasks. However, it is more commonly used in classification problems. The key idea behind SVM is:\n",
    "- It finds a **hyperplane** in an N-dimensional space (where N is the number of features) that best separates the data points into different classes.\n",
    "- The best hyperplane is the one that maximizes the margin between the data points of different classes, and the data points closest to the hyperplane are known as **support vectors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Hyperplane**: A decision boundary that separates different classes.\n",
    "- **Support Vectors**: The data points that lie closest to the hyperplane and are critical in determining the position of the hyperplane.\n",
    "- **Margin**: The distance between the hyperplane and the nearest support vectors. SVM aims to maximize this margin.\n",
    "- **Kernel Trick**: SVM can use different kernel functions (e.g., linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF)) to handle non-linear data by transforming it into a higher-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVM is particularly useful in high-dimensional spaces and is effective in cases where the number of features is larger than the number of samples.\n",

    "1. Choose the appropriate **kernel function** (linear, polynomial, RBF, etc.) based on your data.\n",
    "2. Fit the SVM model on the training data.\n",
    "3. Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data.\n",
