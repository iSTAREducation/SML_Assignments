    "## 1. What is Bagging?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bagging**, or **Bootstrap Aggregating**, is an ensemble learning technique used primarily to improve the stability and accuracy of machine learning algorithms. The key idea is:\n",
    "- It combines multiple models (typically the same type, like Decision Trees) to create a more robust model by reducing variance and improving predictions.\n",
    "- Each individual model is trained on a random subset of the training data, sampled with replacement (this means some data points can appear multiple times in a subset).\n",
    "- The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions of all individual models, usually by voting for classification tasks or averaging for regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Bootstrap Sampling**: Randomly sampling data points from the training set with replacement to create multiple datasets.\n",
    "- **Aggregation**: Combining the predictions from all models to improve overall performance.\n",
    "- **Variance Reduction**: By averaging multiple models, Bagging helps to reduce the model's variance, leading to more stable predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging is particularly effective for high-variance models, such as Decision Trees.\n",

    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Choose the base estimator (e.g., Decision Tree).\n",

    "3. Fit the Bagging model on the bootstrap samples.\n",
    "4. Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data.\n",
