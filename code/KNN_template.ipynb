    "## 1. What is KNN?\n",
    "\n",
    "**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies data points based on the proximity of their neighbors in feature space. The basic idea is:\n",
    "- The algorithm stores all available data points and classifies new data points based on a majority vote of its **k nearest neighbors**.\n",
    "- The data point is assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (where k is a positive integer, typically small).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Instance-based**: The model makes predictions based on specific instances of data.\n",
    "- **Lazy learning**: KNN does not learn a model during the training phase; instead, it computes classifications during the prediction phase.\n",
    "- **Distance metrics**: KNN uses a distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance) to find the closest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, KNN is used for both **classification** and **regression** tasks, but here we will focus on classification.\n",
