    "## 1. What is a Decision Tree?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Tree** is a supervised learning algorithm used for both **classification** and **regression** tasks. It models decisions and their possible consequences in a tree-like structure. The basic idea is:\n",
    "- The algorithm splits the dataset into subsets based on the value of input features, creating a tree-like model of decisions.\n",
    "- Each internal node of the tree represents a feature, each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome (class label).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Root Node**: The topmost node of the tree, representing the entire dataset and the first split.\n",
    "- **Internal Nodes**: Nodes that represent features based on which the data is split.\n",
    "- **Leaf Nodes**: Terminal nodes that represent the final output or class label.\n",
    "- **Splitting**: The process of dividing a node into two or more sub-nodes.\n",
    "- **Impurity Measures**: Common measures like Gini impurity or entropy are used to determine the best feature to split on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees are intuitive and easy to interpret, making them popular for classification tasks.\n",

    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Choose the appropriate **impurity measure** (e.g., Gini impurity, entropy) for the splits.\n",
    "2. Fit the Decision Tree model on the training data.\n",
    "3. Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data.\n",
