    "## 1. What is Random Forest?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Random Forest** is an ensemble learning method primarily used for **classification** and **regression** tasks. It builds multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of their predictions (for classification) or the mean prediction (for regression). The key idea is:\n",
    "- By combining the predictions of several decision trees, Random Forest improves the overall performance and robustness of the model.\n",
    "- Each tree is constructed using a random subset of the training data and a random subset of features, which helps to create diverse trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Bootstrap Sampling**: Randomly sampling data points with replacement to create multiple datasets (similar to Bagging).\n",
    "- **Feature Randomness**: At each split in the tree, only a random subset of features is considered, which adds diversity to the model.\n",
    "- **Ensemble Learning**: Combining multiple models to improve overall performance, reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest is widely used due to its accuracy, ease of use, and ability to handle large datasets with high dimensionality.\n",

    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Choose the number of trees (n_estimators) to include in the forest.\n",
    "2. Create multiple bootstrap samples from the training data.\n",
    "3. Fit the Random Forest model on the bootstrap samples, considering random subsets of features at each split.\n",
    "4. Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data.\n",
    "5. Evaluate the model using the appropriate metrics (explained below).\n",
