    "## 1. What is Logistic Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression** is a supervised learning algorithm used for **binary classification** problems. Despite its name, it is a classification model, not a regression model. The basic idea is:\n",
    "- It predicts the probability that a given data point belongs to a certain class.\n",
    "- The output is transformed using a **sigmoid function** to produce a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Linear Decision Boundary**: Logistic regression models a linear relationship between the input variables and the log-odds of the outcome.\n",
    "- **Sigmoid Function**: This function maps any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which allows us to interpret the output as a probability.\n",
    "- **Threshold-based Classification**: If the predicted probability is above a certain threshold (typically 0.5), the model classifies the instance as one class (e.g., positive class), otherwise, it classifies it as the other class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, logistic regression is often used in scenarios like **disease prediction**, **spam detection**, and **fraud detection**.\n",
